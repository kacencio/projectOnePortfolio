<h1>About Kacey Vicencio</h1>
<p>My name is Kacey Vicencio. I was born and raised in a Filipino household in 
    Daly City, the city right below San Francisco.
Hobbies and interests include fashion, collecting Hirono toys, digital illustration,
 and playing video games like Minecraft, Genshin Impact, and Pokemon. To pass the time, I also like
 watching a lot of OfflineTV videos on YouTube, studying up on how to speak Tagalog, and 
 listening to indie, R&B, and alternative artists like Her's, Lamp, boy pablo, and The Internet.





Currently, I am attending SFSU for a degree in Visual Communications 
and when I'm not at school, I work as a visual merchandiser in retail (those people who dress up the mannequins).

I chose to study design at SFSU because I feel like it is the only major that 
pertains to me. I think it is the one concept to study that felt interesting 
because it would involve projects that require me to think creatively. I wanted 
to respark and rewire my brain to get into something that combined both techy and 
creative elements because for one, Iâ€™ve liked digital art and wanted to have a 
little experience with coding, and because two, life events, especially COVID-19 
quarantine, dulled my drive to want to do anything artistic anymore. Still working on that. Also, SFSU
is relatively nearby, so as an introvert, I want to go home as soon as possible
as much as possible!
