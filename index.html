<h1>About Kacey Vicencio</h1>
<p>My name is Kacey Vicencio. I was born and raised in a Filipino household in 
    Daly City, which is the city right below San Francisco.
Hobbies and interests include fashion, collecting Hirono toys, digital illustration,
 and playing video games like Minecraft, Genshin Impact, and Pokemon. I also enjoy
 watching a lot of OfflineTV videos on YouTube, and currently I'm trying to
 learn how to speak Tagalog, the main Filipino language of the Philippines.





Currently, I am attending SFSU for a degree in Visual Communications 
and when I'm not at school, work as a visual merchandiser in retail.

I chose to study design because I feel like it is the only major that 
pertains to me. I think it is the one concept to study that felt interesting 
because I can see I’ve been having a creative brain most of my life. I wanted 
to respark and rewire my brain to get into something that combined both tech and 
creative elements because for one, I’ve liked digital art and wanted to have a 
little experience with coding, and because two, life events, especially COVID-19 
quarantine, dulled my drive to want to do anything artistic anymore. Hopefully,
through the obtaining of this degree, I will get into a career that pertains to
UI/UX design.
