       <h1>✦ About Kacey Vicencio</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Kacey Vicencio. I was born and raised in a Filipino household in 
            Daly City, the city right below San Francisco. Hobbies and interests include 
            fashion, collecting Hirono toys, digital illustration, and playing video games 
            like Minecraft, Genshin Impact, and Pokemon. To pass the time, I also like 
            watching a lot of OfflineTV videos on YouTube, studying up on how to speak 
            Tagalog, and listening to indie, R&B, and alternative artists like Her's, 
            Lamp, boy pablo, and The Internet.

            Currently, I am attending SFSU for a degree in Visual Communications and when 
            I'm not at school, I work as a visual merchandiser in retail (those people who 
            dress up the mannequins).

            I chose to study design at SFSU because I felt as if it is the only major that 
            pertains to me; I think it felt interesting 
            because it would involve projects that require me to think creatively.
