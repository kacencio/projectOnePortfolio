<h1>Three Artists That Inspire Me</h1>
<h2>Kacey Vicencio DES228</h2>

<h3>Djo</h3>
<p>Djo inspires me through his music to get me through the day. When I listen to Djo's music, I get pumped up to get ready and drive to work, to commute to school, and to do work I need to do.</p>

<h3>Lang</h3>
<p>Lang inspires me through his cohesive art toy branding as well as his dark and deep designs that is usually unseen in POP MART toy lines.</p>

<h3>Jayden Rono</h3>
<p>Jayden Rono inspires me in my favorite outfits to try for more interesting pieces, whether it is in texture, color, or silhouette.</p>
